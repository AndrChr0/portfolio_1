          bachelor's degree in Web Development
        </a>
        . Through my studies, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of
        fundamental web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. Additionally, I have familiarized myself with more complex
        technologies such as PHP, Vue.js, React, Docker, GitHub Actions, and
        software testing. In my spare time, I am an avid climber and an active
        member of different student unions. Outside of school, I am an avid
        climber and an active member in various student unions.
